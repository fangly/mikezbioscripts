cutDown** turns the input file into an 'Illumina style" file.

fast*2fast* are converters mfast*2... convert pairs (Forward / Reverse) to fasta.

selectRand does just that, as does remove_exact_dupes.

velvetFixer reverse complements the second read from a mate pair library so that velvet doesn't spew.
